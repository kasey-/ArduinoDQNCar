# ArduinoDQNCar

You will find here the code for a series of posts following up on running neural networks on an Arduino and pushing the concept furthermore by training first the neural network in a simulator then loading it to an Arduino and refining the training in vivo (my living room).

## How to use it

## Sources & Acknowledgments

This project relies on the code and articles written by:

 * https://github.com/keon/deep-q-learning
 * https://github.com/harvitronix/reinforcement-learning-car

## Todo

### Cleanup

 - [x] Write the readme description and add github tags to the project
 - [x] Add references to used source code and licence repository
 - [x] Organize folders (Python, Dataset, Tinn, Articles Steps, Pictures, etc...)
 - [ ] Split python simulator for DQN code

### Get it working

 - [ ] Fine tune hyper parameters
 - [ ] Regularly save models
 - [ ] Refactor code to generate training dataset for Tinn 
 - [ ] Implement training refinement in vivo
 - [ ] Write how to use it
 
### Improvements

 - [ ] Test mini league selection
 - [ ] Improve simulator
 - [ ] Improve DQN algo
